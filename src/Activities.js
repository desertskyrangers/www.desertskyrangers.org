						This time we chose to fly in the afternoon which turned out to be

						came up to give us fantastic flying weather. Micah brought his dad
						out to fly with us along with a beautiful modified Piper Cub.
						Hudson put in several more flights on his Bixler II and had great
						landings. Noah flew his Bixler and Arrow. Unfortunately the Arrow
						had a spectacular nose-in landing so he will be working on a new
						build soon. Glen brought out several new aircraft. His biplane
						struggled to get off the ground due to the long grass, and even
						then, the flights were nothing more than a hop. His Cronos I had
						its maiden flight and after putting in a 4S battery flew nicely.
						Last, but not least, Holden got one launch with his new rocket.
						We're not sure how high it went but we were glad the parachute did
						not fully deploy so it came down nearby. Apparently we were having
						so much fun flying, we didn't get any photos. All in all, a good
